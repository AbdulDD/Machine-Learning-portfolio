# Machine-Learning-portfolio
ML repository is a place for my projects, tutorial notebooks, EDA on Tabular data, ML algorithms and other ML Tasks. This is a Portfolio repository.

# Key_Features
1. Tabular Data Preprocessing (data cleaning, transformations, & Feature Engineering...e.t.c.)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Use of Pre-trained models for ML Tasks
4. ML Algorithms and Models
5. Tutorial Notebooks

# Task_Statement
For each and every task in this repository, a document (Task statement) is given that shares important details, required libraries, Task requirements and Link to Datasets for the Task. This will be helpful for reproducibility of the task, if you want to reproduce it.

# Datasets
Datasets used for different tasks are either public or created. For public datasets, links are given in task statement. For created datasets they are placed in dataset folder.

# Projects
1. Diagnosis of Disease using Random Forest: Tree Ensemble
